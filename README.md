# bookmarq

A bookmark-sharing platform built on NextJS and MongoDB (using mongoose ODM). It comes with TailwindCSS and NextUI elements. The authentication is provided by Google Auth using next-auth.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
